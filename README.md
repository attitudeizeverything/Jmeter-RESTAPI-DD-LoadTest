# Jmeter-RESTAPI-DD-LoadTest
Jmeter REST API Functional-Load Testing Using Data Driven Approach

# data-driven-jmeter-rest-api-test
A simple data-driven approach for using jmeter to write api test

# Goal:

Framework to test REST API with different HTTP Methods and use it for Load Testing. This test will be driven through a spreadsheet which contains all the input parameters, API URL, HTTP Method, request JSON, text response should be used for assertion etc.

By using one single HTTP Sampler, we would like to send different types of request GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE. 
HTTP Request body data will be added dynamically at run time.
